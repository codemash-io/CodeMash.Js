# Roadmap

### Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

* A **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases.
* A **feature area** that indicates the area of the product to which the item belongs. For a list of current product areas, see below.
* A **feature** that indicates the feature or product to which the item belongs. For a list of current features, see below.

### Release phases

* **alpha:** _Primarily for testing and feedback_ Limited availability, requires a pre-release agreement. Features still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for production use, and no documentation, SLAs, or support provided.
* **beta:** _Publicly available in a full or limited capacity_ Features mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements for GA usually published. No SLAs or support provided.
* **ga:** _Generally available to all customers_ Ready for production use with associated SLA and technical support obligations. Approximately 1-2 quarters from Beta.

Some of our features may still be in the exploratory stages and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. These are marked as follows:

* **in design:** Feature in the discovery phase. We have decided to build this feature, but are still figuring out _how_.
* **exploring:** Feature under consideration. We are considering building this feature, and gathering feedback on it.

### Sms

* CodeMash provides you a simple and reliable messaging system built for apps. Our transactional **email** and **push** solutions effectively support developers and marketers alike. On top of the messaging service, we will provide the capability to send messages using SMS services like Twilio.

### Payments

* We will allow you to implement [ChargBee](https://www.chargebee.com/) payment gateway.

### Translations

* We will provide a new module called "Translations" - localization features that simplify your work. You will get an environment where you can do translations, invite people to enroll as contributors, export translations into favorable format: i18n \(lightweight simple translation module with dynamic JSON storage\), resx \(XML based files\), and other popular formats. 



## 2021-12-01

### Code

* We will provide a new "Deploy" functionality for the CodeMash Code module. You will be able to describe your app deployment into YAML format. The idea is to provide the capability to bootstrap your app into GitHub with all the necessary assets and allow you to do customization on top of it.
