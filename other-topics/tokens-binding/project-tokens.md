# Project Tokens

The project has its own default tokens which will be by default injected into your templates. The following shows what these tokens are and where can they be used.

You can also add your own custom tokens in your project settings. Then just like with default project tokens, your defined custom tokens will be by default injected into your templates.

## Tokens

The following are default project tokens.

| Token | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Project.Name | Display name of your project. |
| Project.SlugifiedName | Unique name of your project \(in lowercase\). |
| Project.Url | Your project's URL set in settings. |

## Where are they used

These tokens can be used in the following places:

* Email templates
* Notification templates

In triggers, you can select different token names for these token values.
