# Request Tokens

Request tokens are tokens that can be passed to a send request. This allows to use dynamic token values which cannot be achieved with project tokens.

## Tokens

Tokens are passed to requests \(like send email or push notification requests\) in key value pairs. Token key  must match a token in your template to be injected.

## Where are they used

These tokens can be used in the following places:

* Email templates
* Notification templates
