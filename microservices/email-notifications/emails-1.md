# Emails

Emails internally are grouped into email groups. Every time you send an email to one or more recipients a new group will be created which holds all individual emails \(one for each recipient\) together. These groups can be viewed from the dashboard, emails queue page.

#### Cc and Bcc recipients

Cc and Bcc recipients will be added for each email. That means, if you are sending email to two or more recipients, those that are set as Cc or Bcc will get two or more messages. So if you decide to send copies, send an email only to a single recipient.
{% endhint %}

## Emails API

Exposed API email methods allow sending emails. All other email management operations are done through the dashboard.
