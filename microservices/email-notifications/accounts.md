# Email Accounts

Accounts are email providers that can be used to send your emails. Currently, we support three email providers - **Twilio Sendgrid**, **MailGun,** and **Amazon SES**. If you are not specifying which account to use, all your emails will be sent from the default account. You can specifically set an account for each template.
