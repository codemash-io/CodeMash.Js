# Logs

In your dashboard, you can see all the logs created in your project. There are several types of logs - requests, request errors, business errors, and custom logs.

## Types of logs

The following are the types of logs available for use:

* **Request** - log of a request called from outside the dashboard.
* **Request Error** - log of a failed request called from outside and from the dashboard.
* **Business Error** - log of internal error \(errors that happened in background processing\). 
* **Custom** - a custom log created using the [API](https://docs.codemash.io/sdks) method.

## Logs API methods

Exposed [API](https://docs.codemash.io/sdks) logs methods allow you to create your own logs.
