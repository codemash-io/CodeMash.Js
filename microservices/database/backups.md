# Backups

You can dump all your collections, taxonomies, records, and terms in case you want to rebuild the former version of the database. Backups can be created manually or daily at a specific time frame. The maximum amount of backups saved are seven. When creating a new backup, the oldest backup is deleted if the cap is exceeded.
