# Backups

You can dump all your collections, taxonomies, records and terms in case you want to rebuild to previous version. Backups can be created manually or daily at a specific time frame. The maximum amount of backups saved are seven. When creating a new backup, the oldest backup is deleted if the cap is exceeded.
