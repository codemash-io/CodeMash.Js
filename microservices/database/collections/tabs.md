# Tabs

Tabs allow you to visually organize your fields. That means that tabs do not change data structure in any way, it only groups your fields together so that when viewing records through the dashboard, you can view these tabs separately.

## Managing tabs

You can create/select a tab inside the field configuration dialog window under the advanced option.

Once you have created a tab and saved a field, your tab is created and can be viewed inside the **Tabs** tab on your collection page. There you can reorder, move, and delete your tabs.

## Tabs in action

Your tabs can be seen in the record page. Here fields under the **Address tab** are shown together. Other fields will be in other tabs or a default tab **Other** if no tab for a field is selected.
