# Functions

Functions are scripts that can be executed at various places such as triggers, scheduler tasks, or using the API requests. If you don't have any cloud provider in place, you can still upload code functions using our dashboard.

## Adding provider functions

You can add functions from external providers. More about that check the link below.

{% page-ref page="../accounts/" %}

## Adding custom functions

You can create and upload your own custom function to CodeMash. To do so navigate to the functions list and from there press **Add New** button. From the opened page select to add custom function.

To add a custom function you will have to create a function externally and then upload a zipped function during function creation. Below are the links to pages for each available runtime.
