# Functions

Functions are scripts which can be executed at various places such as triggers, scheduler tasks or during an API requests. Currently the only supported provider for functions is AWS Lambda, but you are not required to have an AWS account, you can add functions directly through the dashboard.

## Adding provider functions

You can add functions from external providers. More about that check the link below.

{% page-ref page="../accounts/" %}

## Adding custom functions

You can create and upload your own custom function to CodeMash. To do so navigate to functions list and from there select to add new function or you can also do this by selecting CodeMash account from code accounts list. From the opened page select to add custom function.

To add a custom function you will have to create a function externally and then upload zipped function during function creation. Below are the links to pages for each available runtime.
