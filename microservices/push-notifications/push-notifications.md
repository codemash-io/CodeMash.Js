# Push Notifications

Push notifications internally are grouped into notification groups. Every time you send a notification to one or more recipients a new group will be created which holds all individual messages \(one for each recipient\) together. These groups can be viewed from the dashboard, push notifications queue page.

## Push Notifications API

Exposed API push notification methods allow sending and managing user notifications.
